# Workshop on Bayesian inference and JASP

> Sorry, professor, I didnâ€™t catch that. What is a *p*-value again? And --- can I be confident in my confidence intervals? Do we have the statistical power for that? Most lecturers will either stutter at your questions, or point to the unintuitive nature of these statistical concepts. They are, after all, exceptionally hard to grasp; for students and statisticians alike. In this workshop, I (re)introduce you to classical concepts such as the *p*-value, confidence intervals, and statistical power. On examples, we will see how easy and common it is to misinterpret them. I will discuss the fickle nature of statistical inference based on *p*-values, contextualising their (mis)use within the reproducibility crisis in science. As a powerful alternative, I introduce the Bayesian statistical paradigm, and show you how to practically apply its concepts using the free software JASP. Note that there are no requirements for this workshop; but if you get a chance, you can already install JASP (https://jasp-stats.org/installation-guide/). All materials including slides, code, and further resources will be made available at https://github.com/fdabl/Bayes-JASP.

Below is a timeline I have used to prepare this workshop. You might find it useful, so I'll leave it here.
